- ### 🗒️ [[Weekly review]]
	- #### 👷 What did I work on
		- Many non-scientific tasks
		- Data analysis of the [[Experiment/ZePSI-E-013/009]] makes sense
		- Work a bit on the determination of the coefficients of the OOP-ESEEM vs beta for singlet-born pairs
	- #### 🤔 Reflections
		- Next year will be even better than this one :)
		- I will perform this infamous experiment that is taking some months to work properly
		- Let's go!!
