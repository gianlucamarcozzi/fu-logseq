- 9:30 -> 12:00 | Relaxed reading and plotting of things
- 13:30 -> 15:00 | Data analysis of [[Experiment/ZePSI-E-013]] ESEEM vs beta | [[category/Data analysis]] [[project/ZePSI]]
- ### üóíÔ∏è [[Weekly review]]
	- #### üë∑ What did I work on
		- Data analysis of ESEEM vs \beta
		- Run the second try of the ESEEM vs \beta on PSI powder at 150 K
			- Signal was clipped at high power
			- No low power data due to initial phase shift of the microwave
		- Hardware programming of Rohde&Schwarz RTO 1024 oscilloscope
	- #### ü§î Reflections
		- Still really need to order things for EDMR!
		- Must run the ESEEM vs \beta once again
		- I should also run **ESEEM in the dark** for a good subtraction and phasing of the signal
