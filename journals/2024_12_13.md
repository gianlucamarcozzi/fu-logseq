- ### 🗒️ [[Weekly review]]
	- #### 👷 What did I work on
		- Measure on Lyra with [[A. Vereshchagin]]
		- Still trying to run ESEEM vs beta
			- On two occasions the experiment stopped overnight due to magnet failure and specJet error
			- Once the R&S oscilloscope did not correctly measure the RM and TM channel
				- This needs optimization
			- Strange phase behavior, I need to discuss with Bittl
	- #### 🤔 Reflections
		- Feeling productive and that I am using my skills to program the experiment as I want (and also helping in the lab solve some programming problems)
		- It would be nice to write a program for hardware programming of the homemade spectrometers but might take too much time
