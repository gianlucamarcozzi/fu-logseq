		- Sample [[CasZnO-S-001]]
			- Shell defects around g=2.003 detected, no core defects (g = 1.96) detected
			- 🙂 Light dependence observed for shell defects with blue laser \lambda = 450nm

			- Next step: annealing
		- Sample [[CasZnO-S-002]]
			- Shell defects detected, no core defects detected
			- ☹️ No light dependence observed -> maybe misalignment of laser?
			- Next step: measure again
