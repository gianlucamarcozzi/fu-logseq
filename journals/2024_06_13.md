	- Substrates with electrodes
	  project:: [[projects/CasZnO]]
		- Measure resistance for the substrates at 10V and found a strange behaviour on the IV curve afterwards (damage?)
		- ((666ac3cc-a031-476f-8bf4-cbe8bfcefd3c))
- DONE Measure all the substrates and separate working electrodes from short-circuited ones
