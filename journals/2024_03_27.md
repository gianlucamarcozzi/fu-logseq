  type:: seminar
	- **Bloch sphere**: in the z-axis you have |0>  and |1> along the positive and negative direction, respectevely; in the plane you have (|0> + i |1>)/sqrt(2) and (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) as states along the x- and y-axis respectively
	- **Interference** can be explained with a quantum circuit example on a spin 1/2
		- The first quantum circuit is: Hadamard transformation, measurement, Hadamard transformation, measurement -> for initial state |0>, the result will be |0> or |1> with 50% probability each
		- The second quantum cirucit is: Hadamard transformation, Hadamard transformation, measurement -> for initial state |0>,  the result will be |0> with 100% probability due to interference
		- Hadamard transformation is H = [1, 1; 1, -1]/sqrt(2)
	- **Entanglement** (systems with more than one spin):
		- If the state is factorizable, then it is a product state: e.g. (|0, 0> + |1, 0>)/sqrt(2) can be written as (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) X |0>
		- A state that is entangled cannot be factorized: e.g. (|0, 0> + |1, 1>)/sqrt(2)
	- For computations: **quantum advantage or quantum speed-up**: use superposition of states on the same processor to bring forward calculations on different initial states. A classical computer can do only one initial state on each processor -> you convert an exponential problem to a linear problem (for example in encryption)
	- **Molecular nanomagnets (MNM)** consist of good possible qubits because
		- They are multilevel systems (e.g. S = 1/2 and I = 7/2), this can be used for quantum correction (they are qudits)
		- Chemical tunability -> single addressability and tunability of the interaction between e.g. electron spins to control finely the entanglement
		- They can be used in hybrid systems e.g. in combination with superconductiong resonators
		- They have long T2 at RT
	- **Quantum error correction**: the correct way of simulating evolution is to calculate exp($\Pi_i \int_0^{t_i} H_i dt$) for infinitesimal time intervals, that is t_i -> 0, i -> infinity. But the longer the computation takes, the more prone to errors the alghoritm because of noise (random flips of spins, interaction with environment, ...)
		- To correct: you introduce more qubits and your states are not corrupted by random flips (the MNMs offer natural quantum error correction if you use large number of spins, e.g. VOTPP with I = 7/2)
		- Note that, prior to correct an error, you have to check if there error is there. To do this, you cannot measure the spins and collapse the wavefunctions, otherwise you are changing the experiment. Instead what you do is measure, for example, the parity of the system. You have to find a clever way not to collapse the wavefunction, basically
	- Challenge: **single molecule initialization and readout**
		- The interaction with B0 is weak, therefore you can't initialize individual spins
		- CISS comes in handy because
			- Considering a tryad D-\chi-A-Q, after CISS ET from D to A, with a simple sequence you can move the polarization from A to Q
				- This happens because: |upA, downQ> and |upA, upQ> are equally populated, while |downA, downQ> and |downA, upQ> are empty because of CISS. Therefore you make the transition with a mw pulse from |upA, upQ> to |downA, upQ>, and then with another mw pulse from |upA, downQ> to |upA, upQ> and you obtain complete polarization of Q
			- To setup single qubits a way is to use superconducting resonators, where there is strong interaction between spin and light
			- For readout, the ET from D to A is dependent on the spin of the electron, therefore if A has charge it means that the spin state of A is for sure up, for example. If A does not have charge, then the electron must be in D with spin down. You can use single-charge semiconductors to detect the local charge on A
		- You can also work with **ensembles** of identical qubits, but then you will be able to compute only expectation values (that is averages). If you are interested in projective measurements, such as for example quantum error correction, where you want to know the wavefunction of one individual qubit, then you cannot work with the whole ensemble
	- **trEPR on D-\chi-A**
		- If the ET is fast, then the initial state will always be a singet!
		- In trEPR, depending on the orientation of the chiral bridge, singlet and CISS initial conditions will give the same or different absorption-emission spectrum, because the initial states will be differently populated
			- This is why in Eckvahl et al. they measured for two orientations of the samples: in one they see that CISS has the same spectrum as singlet, in the other they see that there is a superposition of CISS and singlet initial states
		- Easier to see on liquid crystals, hard to see on powder or isotropic solutions
