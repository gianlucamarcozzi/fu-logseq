- ### 🗒️ [[Weekly review]] 2024-11-29
	- #### 👷 What did I work on
		- Develop data analysis for ESEEM vs beta including Rabi nutations experiments
		- Run the first experiment ESEEM vs beta on PSI powder at 150 K
		- Work on travel expense statement for Florence
	- #### 🤔 Reflections
		- Really need to order things for EDMR!
		- Discuss with Mr. Bittl about results of this experiment and possible improvements:
			- Change the **power range** explored because there are a lot of measurements with low value of turning angle beta
				- Maybe have an idea of the range and density of points to probe as tuning angles
					- Non linear sampling (non linspace) could also be an idea
			- Find a way to better **determine power** at low turning angle values (Rabi loses coherence too fast)
				- GPIB connection with oscilloscope?
			- Alternative **Rabi nutation** experiment: several pulses in the same aquisition?
			- Longer **ESEEM traces**
