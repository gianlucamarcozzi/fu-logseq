- Meeting with [[J. McPeak]] about Sijia's project
	- Look more in depth to the rel ampl of the exponential contributions of Tm
	  project:: [[projects/Sijia sulphurization]]
	  type:: [[Someday maybe]]
	- Next possible experiment: temperature dependent Tm and T1 to identify the processes
	  project:: [[projects/Sijia sulphurization]]
	  type:: [[Someday maybe]]
	- Fit fse with anisotropic g instead of two "high field" contributions
