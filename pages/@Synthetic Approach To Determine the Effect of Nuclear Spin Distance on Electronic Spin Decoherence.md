- [[Abstract]]
	- Nuclear−electronic interactions are a fundamental phenomenon which impacts ﬁelds from magnetic resonance imaging to quantum information processing (QIP). The realization of QIP would transform diverse areas of research including accurate simulation of quantum dynamics and cryptography. One promising candidate for the smallest unit of QIP, a qubit, is electronic spin. Electronic spins in molecules oﬀer signiﬁcant advantages with regard to QIP, and for the emerging ﬁeld of quantum sensing. Yet relative to other qubit candidates, they possess shorter superposition lifetimes, known as coherence times or T2, due to interactions with nuclear spins in the local environment. Designing complexes with suﬃciently long values of T2 requires an understanding of precisely how the position of nuclear spins relative to the electronic spin center aﬀects decoherence. Herein, we report the ﬁrst synthetic study of the relationship between nuclear spin−electron spin distance and decoherence. Through the synthesis of four vanadyl complexes, (Ph4P)2[VO(C3H6S2)2] (1), (Ph4P)2[VO(C5H6S4)2] (2), (Ph4P)2[VO(C7H6S6)2] (3), and (Ph4P)2[VO(C9H6S8)2] (4), we are able to synthetically place a spin-laden propyl moiety at well-deﬁned distances from an electronic spin center by employing a spin-free carbon−sulfur scaﬀold. We interrogate this series of molecules with pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to determine their coherence times. Our studies demonstrate a sharp jump in T2 when the average V−H distance is decreased from 6.6(6) to 4.0(4) Å, indicating that spin-active nuclei suﬃciently close to the electronic spin center do not contribute to decoherence. These results illustrate the power of synthetic chemistry in elucidating the fundamental mechanisms underlying electronic polarization transfer and provide vital principles for the rational design of long-coherence electronic qubits.
