- [[Abstract]]
	- The electron-spin relaxation of iron-sulphur centres in a range of simple proteins (ferredoxin, high-potential iron-sulphur protein and rubredoxin) was investigated by means of the temperature dependence and microwave power saturation of the EPR signal. The proteins containing [2Fe-2S] centres all showed temperature optima higher than those for [4Fe-4S] centres, but the difference between the slowest-relaxing [4Fe-4S] protein (Chromatium highpotential iron-sulphur protein) and the fastest-relaxing [2Fe-2S] protein (Halobacterium halobium ferredoxin) was small. A greater distinction was seen in the power saturation behaviour at low temperature (10--20 K). The behaviour of the signal intensity as a function of microwave power was analyzed in terms of the power for half saturation P~n and the degree of homogeneous/inhomogeneous broadening. The effect of distorting the protein structure by salts, organic solvents and urea was to decrease the electron-spin relaxation rate as shown b y a decreased value of P1/2. The addition of Ni 2+ as a paramagnetic perturbing agent caused an increase in the electron-spin relaxation rate of all the proteins, with the exception of adrenal ferredoxin, as shown by an increased P1/2 and, in a few cases, broadening of the linewidth. Ferricyanide, a commonly used oxidizing agent, has similar effects. These results are discussed in relation to the use of paramagnetic probes to determine whether ironsulphur centres are near to a membrane surface. Spin-spin interactions between two paramagnetic centres in a protein molecule such as a 214Fe-4S] ferredoxin, lead to more rapid electron-spin relaxation. This method was used to detect a spin-spin interaction between molybdenum V and centre Fe-SI in xanthine oxidase.
