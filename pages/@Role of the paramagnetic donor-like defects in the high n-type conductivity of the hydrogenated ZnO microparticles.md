	- Abstract
	              
	                The magnetic and electronic properties of the hydrogenated highly conductive zinc oxide (ZnO) microparticles were investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and contactless microwave (MW) conductivity techniques in the wide temperature range. The EPR spectra simulation allowed us to resolve four overlapping EPR signals in ZnO microparticles. The Lorentzian EPR line with isotropic
	                g
	                -factor 1.9623(5) was related to the singly ionized oxygen vacancy. Another Lorentzian line with
	                g
	                ||
	                 = 1.9581(5),
	                g
	                ⊥
	                 = 1.9562(5) was attributed to the zinc interstitial shallow donor center, while EPR signal with
	                g
	                ||
	                 = 1.9567(5),
	                g
	                ⊥
	                 = 1.9556(5) and Gaussian lineshape was assigned to the hydrogen interstitial shallow effective-mass-like donor. The EPR signal with
	                g
	                ||
	                 = 1.9538(5),
	                g
	                ⊥
	                 = 1.9556(5) and Lorentzian lineshape was tentatively attributed to the shallow donor center. The charge transport properties in ZnO microparticles have been investigated by the contactless MW conductivity technique at

	                 = 5–296 K. Two conduction mechanisms, including ionization of electrons from the shallow donors to the conduction band and hopping conduction process, have been distinguished. The hopping conduction process follows Mott’s variable-range hopping

	                 = 10–100 K. The evaluated values of the average hopping distance (15.86 Å), and hopping energy (1.822 meV at 40 K) enable us to estimate the donor concentration in the investigated ZnO microparticles as ~ 10
