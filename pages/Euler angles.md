- To bring xyz to ABC you need three angles (zyz convention):
	- Rotation of \alpha around the z-axis (z = z') to bring y -> y' in the AB plane
	- Rotation of \beta around the y'-axis (y' = y'') to bring z (= z') -> C (= z'')
	- Rotation of \gamma around the z'' (= C)-axis (z'' = z''') to bring x'' -> A (= x''') and y'' -> B (= y''')
- A vector (0, 0, 1) in the lab frame can be expressed as (-sin(\beta)cos(\gamma), sin(\beta)cos(\gamma), cos(\gamma)) in the molecular frame, where \alpha, \beta, \gamma are the Euler angles to go from the lab to the molecular frame
	- The relationship with the polar and azimuthal angles is \gamma = \theta, \beta = \pi - \phi
