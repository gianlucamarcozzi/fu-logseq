- Overall I don't know if I would trust this paper
- They state that under blue light the core (or bulk) signal is enhanced more than the shell (or surface) signal
	- Opposite to what is stated in [[@Photoactivity under visible light of defective ZnO investigated by EPR spectroscopy and photoluminescence]]

- (?) Annealing enlarges the linewidths, that then go back to the previous value in some hours
	- Here they mention only changes in the linewidth immediatly after annealing. No mention at all about intensity. This is not something that they report in [[@Role of the paramagnetic donor-like defects in the high n-type conductivity of the hydrogenated ZnO microparticles]].
