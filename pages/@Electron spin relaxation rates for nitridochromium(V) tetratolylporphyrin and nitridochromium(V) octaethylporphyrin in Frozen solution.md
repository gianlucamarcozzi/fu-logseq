- [[Abstract]]
	- T, and Tm for nitridochromiwn(V) tetratolylporphyrin and nitridochromiwn(V) octaethylporphyrin were measured by saturation recovery and electron spin echo EPR, respectively, between 10 and 130 K. The temperature dependence of liT, was similar to that observed previously for chromiwn(V) complexes of hydroxycarboxylic acids. The spin lattice relaxation rate was faster in the perpendicular plane (the porphyrin plane) than normal to this plane. IITm was orientation dependent with the fastest rates observed for orientations intermediate between the principal axes. The orientation dependence of IITm increased with increasing temperature and decreasing rigidity of the matrix, and is attributed to molecular motion.
