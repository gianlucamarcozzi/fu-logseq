- Many things are not completely clear!
- In T$_1$ samples (where the interaction between electrons spins can be neglected and also between nuclear spins themselves) the free induction decay is prolonged by nuclear spin flips
	- Note that the increase of nuclear concentration increases the $\Delta\omega_{1/2}$ dipolar term, hence making the decay faster
	- (?) Which is coherent with the concept of echo dephasing: if the decay is longer it means that spins will refocus in a larger time range, meaning that they lost the phase coherence
	- This means also that the signal in fourier transform will be sharper
