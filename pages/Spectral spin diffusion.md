- There is a certain radius (around 4 to 8 angstrom) inside which the interaction between electron and nuclear spins is strong and there are no flip-flops therefore the nuclear spins do not influence the Tm
	- I think that the flip-flops do not occur because the vicinity of the electron spin shifts the resonance frequency of the nuclear spin, therefore a flip-flop between the very neighboring nucleus and another one slightly more distant cannot happen

		- Attention because the phenomena of spin diffusion (spatial) and decoherence are not exactly the same
