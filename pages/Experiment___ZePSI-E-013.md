## Notes about ESEEM vs beta experiments
	- ||ZePSI-E-013002|ZePSI-E-013004|
	  |--|--|--|
	  |Phase problem|No|Yes (see first two measurements)|
	  |Rabi intensity|Not so large|Large|
	  |Rabi phase|Dark signal was on the in-phase channel|100 degree phase to bring dark signal to in-phase channel|
	  |Rabi shape|Only absorptive feature, no signal in the out-of-phase channel|Dispersive shape in the out-of-phase channel after "phase correction"|
	  |Rabi nut2 frequency|40 MHz|41 Mhz, first negative peak (pi-pulse) at 12 ns|
