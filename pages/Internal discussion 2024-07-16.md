- VOTPP
	- Our idea is that the surface of the quartz (probably the non-passivated dangling bonds) attract the VOTPP causing aggregation
	- Brainstorm idea for deposition of VOTPP in P3HT
		- Use a substrate of sapphire (EPR signal?) or ITO (EPR signal and also broad VOTPP signal) or MICA (not sure this is the correct spelling, this is a silicate mineral though therefore probably there are the same problems as for quartz)
		- Mix of P3HT with something else to hopefully stabilize
		- Structure of quartz substrate, layer of PMMA, layer of VOTPP:P3HT (one would use orthogonal solvents in order to avoid solving the PMMA again)
			- Problem: layer of PMMA has a non optimally controllable thickness
		- Sandwich structure with layer in between: ITO, PMMA, VOTPP:P3HT, contact evaporated with a shadow mask
		- Plastic, PMMA, VOTPP:P3HT, grid contacts evaporated with shadow mask (min possible grid spacing would be 50 um)
	- Next: EDMR on 10 percent and 1 percent VOTPP:P3HT on quartz: even if the signal is broadened this would anyway be a proof of principle
- ZnO: try trEPR
