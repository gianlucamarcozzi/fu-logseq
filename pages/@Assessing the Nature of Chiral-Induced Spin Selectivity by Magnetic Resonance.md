- [[Abstract]]
	- Understanding chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), resulting from charge transport through helical systems, has recently inspired many experimental and theoretical eﬀorts but is still the object of intense debate. In order to assess the nature of CISS, we propose to focus on electron-transfer processes occurring at the single-molecule level. We design simple magnetic resonance experiments, exploiting a qubit as a highly sensitive and coherent magnetic sensor, to provide clear signatures of the acceptor polarization. Moreover, we show that information could even be obtained from time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance experiments on a randomly oriented solution of molecules. The proposed experiments will unveil the role of chiral linkers in electron transfer and could also be exploited for quantum computing applications.
