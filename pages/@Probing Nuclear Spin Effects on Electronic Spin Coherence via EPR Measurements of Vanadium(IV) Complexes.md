- [[Abstract]]
	- Quantum information processing (QIP) has the potential to transform numerous ﬁelds from cryptography, to ﬁnance, to the simulation of quantum systems. A promising implementation of QIP employs unpaired electronic spins as qubits, the fundamental units of information. Though molecular electronic spins oﬀer many advantages, including chemical tunability and facile addressability, the development of design principles for the synthesis of complexes that exhibit long qubit superposition lifetimes (also known as coherence times, or T2) remains a challenge. As nuclear spins in the local qubit environment are a primary cause of shortened superposition lifetimes, we recently conducted a study which employed a modular spin-free ligand scaﬀold to place a spin-laden propyl moiety at a series of ﬁxed distances from an S = 1/2 vanadium(IV) ion in a series of vanadyl complexes. We found that, within a radius of 4.0(4)−6.6(6) Å from the metal center, nuclei did not contribute to decoherence. To assess the generality of this important design principle and test its eﬃcacy in a diﬀerent coordination geometry, we synthesized and investigated three vanadium tris(dithiolene) complexes with the same ligand set employed in our previous study: K2[V(C5H6S4)3] (1), K2[V(C7H6S6)3] (2), and K2[V(C9H6S8)3] (3). We speciﬁcally interrogated solutions of these complexes in DMF-d7/toluene-d8 with pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy and found that the distance dependence present in the previously synthesized vanadyl complexes holds true in this series. We further examined the coherence properties of the series in a diﬀerent solvent, MeCN-d3/toluene-d8, and found that an additional property, the charge density of the complex, also aﬀects decoherence across the series. These results highlight a previously unknown design principle for augmenting T2 and open new pathways for the rational synthesis of complexes with long coherence times.
