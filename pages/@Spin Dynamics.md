	- This article introduces the fundamental concepts, a general methodology, and the tools for following the quantum evolution of the electron magnetic moments during some basic pulse EPR experiments using electron and nuclear angular momentum operators. After a general introduction, we define the electron magnetic moment and the single-electron spin Zeeman Hamiltonian in terms of angular momentum operators. The eigenstates of the electron in an external magnetic field are derived and their time dependence is presented in vector form. To describe macroscopic systems, it is necessary to introduce the spin density operator describing ensembles of electron spin states and the Liouville–von Neumann rate equation that is used to describe the dynamics of the system. We then proceed to the introduction of the rotating frame, and the effect of microwave (MW) irradiation on the electron spin is described by the rate equations for the expectation values of the components of its magnetic moment vector operator. The influence of spin relaxation is discussed only briefly. After introducing the abovementioned general concepts, the effects of MW pulses on the electron spin are described using the angular momentum operator expansions and their mutual transformation rules. We then proceed with an example showing how the tools presented are used to calculate the spin dynamics during the application of the two-pulse Hahn echo for a single electron spin, S = 1/2 system. In the following section, the single-electron spin system is extended to a coupled two-electron spin system. Here, the orthogonal set of product angular momentum operators used to express the Hamiltonian and the spin density operator are presented and are used to calculate the evolutions of this spin system during a three-pulse electron–electron double-resonance (DEER) experiment designed to measure the dipolar and exchange interaction between the two spins. The last section deals with an electron-nucleus spin system. It starts with defining its product angular momentum operators and their linear combinations resulting in the fictitious spin-1/2 operators. Supported by their mutual transformation rules, it is then shown how to use it to calculate the two-pulse electron-spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) sequence. Finally, we also briefly describe how to calculate the spin evolution in Davies- and Mims- electron–nuclear double-resonance sequences (ENDOR).
